Revision history for Perl module DarkPAN::Creator

1.28_11 - 2010-02-23
	* Added a lot of docs, including the new UserManual.pm

1.28_07 - 2010-02-18
	* it's now dpan_dir, not backpan_dir. The old configuration still
	works though.
	* other directories with dists to pull in go into merge_dirs
	* Fixed problem with adding X-SVN header to 02packages.


1.28_06 - 2010-02-18
	* The error reports from Minimal.pm now dump all the info the indexer
	collected, and puts the error messages at the top of the error report.
	* If there is an .svn directory in the reporistory, add an X-SVN
	header to 02packages.details.txt.gz
	* dpan now prints a message reminding you to reload your CPAN indices
	in your favorite tool.
	* Supports 00whois.xml and 01mailrc.txt.gz, either by modifying the real
	ones, or making stubs and faking it. This lets CPAN::Mini::Webserver
	work.
	* The Reporter final_words stuff is now moved in its own Collator
	object. This removes a lot of special cases for hooking into the
	Reporter outside of examining a dist.

1.28_03 - 2009-12-09
	* Support the DPAN_LOGLEVEL environment variable

1.28_02 - 2009-11-30
	* Completely redo how the Minimal reporter decides which
	packages to include in the report. It looks at the package
	name and compares it to the file. If it looks like they
	are the same, that one wins even if another file has the
	same package with a higher version. Otherwise, only the
	highest version of a package gets into the report.

1.28 - 2009-11-20
	* Put relative paths in the indexer reports if you're
	using the organize dists option.
	* Update prereqs to latest version of MyCPAN::Indexer
	and CPAN::PackageDetails.

1.27 - 2009-11-08
	* Now you can set the Log4perl config file with the
	DPAN_LOG4PERL_FILE.
	* Refactored some bits in the Minimal reporter to
	make it easier to override the bits that decide
	which reports to index.

1.22 - 2009-05-21
	* Don't index packages (such as bytes, DB, MM) that are special
	* Don't try to index tests. We don't need them to make DPAN

1.21 - 2009-05-20
	* Handle exit on our own to prevent applications using
	an embedded indexer from stopping prematurely.

1.18_04 - 2009-05-09
	* Worked out some inheritance issues. I really need to use
	roles.

1.18_03 - 2009-05-08
	* Clean up dist
	* Fix problem with _exit inherited from MyCPAN::Indexer. This
	killed applications embedding the DPAN indexer
